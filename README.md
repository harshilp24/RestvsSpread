In your coding journey, you may have come across the terms Rest and Spread and wondered what they are and how they differ. The JavaScript REST and Spread Operators are just two different ways to declaratively create arrays or array-like objects. When someone asks "Whatâ€™s the difference?" They are asking which one is more appropriate for their particular situation.
